# PAC
this code allows to compute the phase amplitude coupling (PAC) based on the algorithm Modulation Index.

It can be used to compute a matrix of PAC with the sliding window over the frequency for phase and amplitude extraction. For visulization, please use imagesc() to plot the matrix generated by the main function.
